I have a problem. I play too much Vidya Gaems. It is not a problem when I play a narative based single player game for fun but when I play something even remotely competitive I become a grustle focused Sigma. I can sink in 6-7 hours easily. Which turns my daily schedule upside down, and has a negative effect in my life. I'm playing until 2AM-3AM in the morning which makes me tired all day long. This gotta stop but I lack the willpower to not to do so. So I'll delegate willpower to a computer program.

# Research
So plan is to have 60 minutes everyday to play. I can decrease or increase based on the circumstances. There is 4 options I considered.

## DIY
There is a feature of windows called "policy". You can setup those to block some certain applications from running. With some basic scripting I would be able to do it. It is free but hard to setup. If you are cash stripped it can be done. [You can continue your researche here.](https://www.technipages.com/prevent-users-from-running-certain-programs)

## Cold Turkey
This is the defacto app blocker when you ask for an app blocker. Everyone knows it, everyone loves it. It has the time blocking power and it is called "allowance". I didn't buy it before because I believed it was a subscription based pricing. In my opinion, I find it very stupid to pay something only runs locally. It is 35$, I believe it is a honest price for an application you would use for a very long time.

## Freedom
Freedom is the other best option. Has the functionality of the cold turkey and also provides syncing across devices. Since I'm not looking for a general app blocker I wasn't interested in syncing across multiple devices. It has a subscription but In this case subscription is justified. If you get Yearly or Forever I believe it is a good value. Forever is too much expensive but it is equal to almost 5 years of yearly subscription.

## Others
If you go to [Alternative to](https://alternativeto.net/) website there is nine gazillion blockers available. Most of them are on/off switches, which is okay if it is what you are looking. Some of them are just browser extensions. [Leech Block](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/leechblock-ng/blaaajhemilngeeffpbfkdjjoefldkok) is a nice option for a just browser blocking. 

# Selection
I decided to go with Cold Turkey! Freedom and DIY options are nice but they have huge cons.

DIY option is free in respect to money but it would be a lot of time dedicated to get it working. And when It breaks down I need to fix it. I didn't want to have a project, I needed a tool.

Freedom is a nice option but I don't need its extra bells and whistles. Thus it just becomes too expensive for my use case. If I want to unify my blocking softwares I think it worths the money on yearly account. I would test for a year and then buy the forever account.

# Setup
After I acquired the software I needed to setup my block settings.
## Time and Allowance Setup

## Blocking Apps Setup

## Problems
For a strange reason Uplay creates a lot of notifications when it get's blocked. I think it might be just me having this problem but I think it can be solved by muting Cold Turkey notifications.
