The game is nice and the gameplay loop is addictive. They need to fix some very basic things that make the game very annoying.

## 1 Fast travelling between regions
The game does not allow you to go to an area without going to the village first. Why? Why I can't just travel to Coastlands to Obsidian Fields.

## 2 Wisp Render Distance
The Wisps can be optimized to PNG or a light effect when the player is away. But currently, Wisps sometimes show up from very far away or they don't show up until you are 1 cm close. It is annoying. And It is not that hard to fix. Wisps can be prioritized to load and rendered.

## 3 Loading Pop-ins
When people develop open-world-ish games, they need to optimize memory usage. Because the whole game data will not fit into the memory itself. Currently, there are multiple different places that are explicitly selected. This helps with memory. This game should not have pop-ins. GTA 4 had minimum requirements that are less than what switch has. Watch a pop-in hiding tutorial on youtube.

## 4 The animations look like shit from a distance
I don't know why but pokémon animations go to 1 fps when you are away. I think it is a memory saving trick. It looks like shit. It should've been patched out with more clever tricks than 1 fps animations.

## 5 The texts...
The texts are very long for their own good. I had to skip most with a turbo controller. Add a voice actor and remove 3/4 of the texts.

To be honest I'm not mad at the textures, unlike everyone. But some of the technical stuff makes me mad every time I boot the game. I think they could've been fixed before launch, with better tooling and a bit more time.
