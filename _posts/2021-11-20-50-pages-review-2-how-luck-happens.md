# Why I'm reading this book?
For the last year, I have been using Blinkist free tier for discovering books I might like. This book caught my eyes or to be more correct my ears. I decided to give it a go to read the whole book. The book tries to explain the luck and what it is in layman's terms.

# Which parts I've finished?
50 pages are exactly the first part and first three chapters. So in this preview, I'll be spoiling the first chapter a little bit.

# Did I learn something new?
I think I didn't learn something new but this book helped me put a new perspective on the stuff I already knew. The authors talk about luck in perspective to statistics and analytic data. Due to my college education and profession, I am exposed to those topics very much. But due to the classic case of horse blinders, it never occurred to me these informations can be applied to life directly.

# Did I like something?
Luck is a random event you won't know when will it happen but you can prepare for these random events. If you are not prepared for **the lucky event** you will miss your chances. *For example,* if you are a musician, and you want someone to discover you. You should keep a copy of your work on you. If they are willing to give it a go, they will be able to give it a go.

The classic Wayne Gretzky quote: "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.". Continuing with the musician example; you see someone can open the doors for you. If you don't even ask for an audience from them, you won't get discovered. It is not rude if you keep things respectful and don't show down your work down somebody's throat.

Very generalized statistics are bullshit. When the statistics are generalized to a single number they don't mean anything and they don't apply to you at all. For example, 13% of people are obese. But there are almost millions of "input dimensions", different factors that change the outcome. When you use only a single number then you are eliminating everything that provides some sort of information. If you want to weigh the possibility of something, you need to find the distribution on your input dimensions. For example, if you include family history, chronic diseases, etc. and just look at the distribution of obese people that fit your description the change might become 80% or 1%. The 13% does not mean anything to you. Nobody is average, everyone is unique. Try to use statistics that fit you better.

The other side of the coin of luck is **risk**. If you are lucky you will achieve something, if you are not you will lose something. This is the basic explanation of taking risks. So taking risks is not always the biggest gain, biggest loss game. You can foresee somewhat accurate expected gain vs expected loss. So taking risks on low loss, big gain situations are the best.

Sometimes big gains are not even necessary. You can either spend your time on big results and a 1 in million chance or very frequent small gains. Which one will be more profitable for you is your call.

# Do I recommend it?
I recommend this book! The text of the book is not that science/statistics heavy, but they explain the concepts in an understandable manner and it is appliable to real life.

# Will I continue Reading?
I will continue reading it to the other cover. It is not that thick so I believe I can finish it very fast.
