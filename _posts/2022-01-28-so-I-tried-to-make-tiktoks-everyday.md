Last 2 weeks or so, I tried to make TikToks every day... It was mainly for getting over the shyness I experience and it seems people who do content creation for living seem to like Tiktok for getting people to their more profitable content platforms like youtube, twitch, etc. I gotta start somewhere, I thought "there's no time like the present".

My main goal was to do something and produce a video about it every day without some overspill between days. So it meant I either managed to do it or everything I've worked on was thrown to do thrash.

The first couple of tries I worked on I tried to not care about recording a video before finishing what I'm trying to do. Then I quickly realized I could show something but it usually meant I was doing a very janky show and tell and there were a lot of context clues missing. So I decided to try recording while doing something.

While trying to balance recording and progress on my side-projects I realized I still had context problems. For example, I tried to record [BTC Bot blog post]({% post_url 2022-01-23-how-i-automated-buying-bitcoin-with-nodered %}) as a TikTok. Then after recording everything I realized I had never shown the before balance, and I couldn't roll back the time so that video went into thrash as well. So before doing a step of the project I started to take a quick voiceless video, even though I didn't think I have use for it as a safety net.

One day I was working on [my home-server]({% post_url 2021-11-28-a-makeshift-home-server %}) to add external HDDs and electrical wiring for 12V components. I set up my phone with a ring light and it was easy to start recording at any moment. Then I realized I need my hands most of the time, especially when I'm cramped in my small storage room. I decided to use my tripod and mic arm to hold the phone hands free. That day I was laser-focused on getting the result I aimed for, I did not dedicate time to edit the videos at all.

So after deciding how much time is enough time to edit videos for TikTok, I tried to plan the next day so it would be easier to shoot and edit. I decided to record a video about how to make your own hot end. At the 15 minute mark of recording I realized, I ordered the wrong part and there was no way to do the video I wanted. So I decided to add a preliminary check before I do anything.

After that, I decided to work on the [animation generation project]({% post_url 2021-12-04-2022-plans-and-goals %}#3d-animation-generating-machine-learning-model), I have been studying machine learning for. I didn't want to start with the machine learning part so I decided to make a very basic animation that I can generate multiple copies of and will be useful in the long run and I can post it to TikTok. After every lesson, I learned by fire and I was able to produce [this shit-terpiece](https://www.tiktok.com/@alchemistake/video/7058016195244592390):
