I wasted another week with no improvements. It turns out I'm becoming an old dog and having hard time learning tricks.

I was having steady improvements on the replacing token support with a vector support, then I realized the masking code was weird and did not match my case at all. So I decided to reformat the code to make it more debuggable, current implementation has a lot of pre-definitions of data consumers then data generators. Thus debuging becomes hard since consumer does not know what class is generating the data so it was not able intellisense.

On other news, I become contributer on Octo4a and scored a Server for 50$.

I'll keep this one short and sweet.
