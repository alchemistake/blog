I'm away from my house while on holiday and I don't have a lot of things to write about. To not break my 1 post-every-week of 2022 policy I decided to write about games I'm playing. I loaded up my Nintendo Switch with only 100MB to spare. I'll try to cover almost 25 games during the holiday weeks.

# Spyro Reignited

I was hyped about Spyro Remakes since I didn't have Playstation 1 or 2 growing up and I always wanted to experience those games. I started playing the first game on the plane. I'm feeling a little conflicted with the game since it is owned by Activision but I trust Toys for Bob. I have an overclocked switch but it was a little bit laggy on some scenes. It might be due to SD card access speeds etc. but it still shouldn't create graphical hiccups. The camera system soured the milk for me I couldn't get used to it. I think the problem could be solved by a keymap like the new God of War game to enable better 2 stick control + actions. I'll retry it on PC again later.

# Splatoon 2

Controls are cool but analog stick + motion control like BOTW is the better system. A good game is a good game. I'll play online when I have the internet. It does not make sense offline that much.

# Cadence of Hyrule

After playing instruments for years I suck at this game. I did a lot I think it will be like my hollow knight story and ill love it when I come back to this.

# Big Brain Academy: Brain vs Brain

It is a good party game. I wouldn't play this alone it is a very nice game to kill time until the food arrives. I will use it to kill time with my wife.

# Bayonetta

First thing first: Menu blurs are reducing readability. Accessibility is a very important thing. Thankfully, it recovers from other aspects. I don't have Wii U so switch port will be my first introduction. I know it is common to have this system in this genre of the game but the difficulty selection system is nice, chapter by chapter approach is granular enough and accessible for many.

I think the first intro was a cool part to have tutorials and let the people become familiar with the game but everything was moved to the actual intro and it had a long video part. It kind of killed the pace but it is a choice. Nothing bad!

There is no HP System but taking damage reduces end of chapter points. It is very cool to enjoy the game when you suck at hack and slashes.
No HP but punishing damages at the end is a good system for beginning hacks and slashers

Touch controls were unnecessary but cool for accessibility.

I find minimalist games weird. I loved the atmosphere of the game. The lack of features is a calculated trade-off for extreme polish. I noticed a lot of small things that are deliberately designed and put there for a reason. The graphical language and clues were clear. So every puzzle was just, you didn't feel that game is not fair with the solution.

I wish I could list the stuff I noticed but I don't want to give spoilers. I want to keep the preview spoiler-free, this is a "test out the game" situation. You are not fed with the story you need to interpret stuff

I sank 2x 4 hours sessions quickly and finished it in two days.
