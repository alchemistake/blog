Because of unforeseen events, I wasn't able to focus on my main project of 2022. Rather than wasting time watching Tiktok, I decided to organize my to-dos. Especially, the small to-dos that are collecting dust.

I realized I have a lot of to-dos in very different places. For example, some of them were already in my todoist. Some of them were on my Obsidian Vault. Some of them were on a `todo.md` on some random code repos. I started by converging them to a single central spot. I created a label called "Optimization" on todoist. I spent a day going through every place and labelling. Whenever I have free time I can do something small I'll use this label to pull very small tasks.

Essentially, I have a complaint box for myself. I collect them in a single place. and Whenever I have time, I'll fix one or two.

One of those small annoyances is that my Octo4a instance disconnects randomly. Whenever It disconnects I have a Tasker automation that will re-connect. But it does not trigger when the screen is off, and the phone is sleeping. I decided to add an external proxy to give the responsibilities to a better-suited device. But not everything was smooth sailing. I failed to set it up because of Nginx configuration files. I quickly realized I won't be able to patch it easily. So I decided to tackle it later. Rather than proxy route, I'll install Zerotier on my router. [This should be easier to set up by the looks of the wiki entry.](https://github.com/mwarning/zerotier-openwrt/wiki)

Not everything in this list will be this technical! In the Octo4a support group, I see the same 3-4 questions pop up every weekend. So I added them to Octo4a Wiki to see fewer of those types of repeat questions.

TLDR: It is nice to have a list of stuff that can take 1-2 hours and increase your life quality.
