>_Bullshit Jobs: A Theory_ is a 2018 book by anthropologist David Graeber that postulates the existence of meaningless jobs and analyzes their societal harm. He contends that over half of societal work is pointless, and becomes psychologically destructive when paired with a work ethic that associates work with self-worth.<sup>[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs)</sup>
 
I came across with the book a while back but I never had the time to read it. I have just finished my first 50 pages and I think it is time for a pause and evaluate the content of this book.

This book is a extension of a essay author had written back in 2013. I have known about this theory since the essay was out. Due to my prior experiences with workplaces and seeing many people with so called bullshit jobs, The essay resonated with me _a lot_.

I believe the book is not cutting it though. I didn't like the repetitive nature of the book (at least in the first 50 pages). In the essay, it is more to the point and author explains the idea in very precise form. This quick and precises approach comes with the lack of evidence or convincing. In the book, author decides to take care of evidence and tries to be more convincing. He collected vast amount of data from the people who claim they have/had a bullshit job. He gives very many and varied anectodes to prove the point.

I felt like this hurt the book in the short run. I decided to put down the book and not comeback. I was already sold to the idea and reading the book got boring very quick.

As my final verdict, I suggest people to read [the essay](atlasofplaces.com/essays/on-the-phenomenon-of-bullshit-jobs/) first, then depending on the view point of yours the next steps vary. If you already agree with the essay you might skip the book but I heard the book has more content down the line like solutions to the this phenomenon. If you can't stomach very repetitive parts, you can skip the first a few chapters to get the new points compared to the essay. If you don't agree with the essay at all, go surf [the anti-work subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/) to prime yourself.
