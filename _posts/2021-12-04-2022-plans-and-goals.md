I decided to make my goals public this year. I believe that would force me to achieve them. Even though 1 person reads this blog, my brain will be in the _get shit done_ mode. Psychology is a weird thing. Even if I don't finish everything I listed, It is ok. As Machiavelli said
> Acting in this like the skilful archer, who seeing that the object he would hit is distant, and knowing the range of his bow, takes aim much above the destined mark; not designing that his arrow should strike so high, but that flying high it may alight at the point intended.‚Äù

I hope I learn and have fun while doing so. I pretty much have same list for 3-4 years straight but I think this is the year I'll say **"This is Done!"**

# Project Plans
## NRO2NSP Forwarder in the Nintendo Switch Itself
Wtf is that lumb of letters and number? If you don't have a hacked switch they don't make any sense but there is a commonly used tool that requires a Windows machine to set up. Essentially, [NRO2NSP Forwarder](https://gbatemp.net/threads/nro2nsp-retroarch-rom-nro-forwarders.519915/) is a home screen shortcuts for homebrew applications. While trying to setup my newly hacked switch, it generated a lot of headache for me and I decided to write this tool for switch itself. TLDR, It will be basic compiler for switch apps inside the Nintendo Switch itself.
## 3D Animation Generating Machine Learning Model
For people unaware, I want to start a video game company for a long long time. I noticed that with small budgets, Indie game companies need to take loans against something to feed the team members. I tought I found a clever way to train a machine learning to design 3D Animations in bulk. Most probably, even if it creates nice animations, it will require human touch but I believe if a tool like this works it will cut a lot of cost and time. Little bit moonshot but I'm optimistic.
## Finishing my 3D Printer kit: P3 Steel
Back in 2018, I bought a 3D printer kit [(Metal framed Prusa i3 MKI clone)](https://reprap.org/wiki/P3Steel) for less than 100$. Even though the frame _etc._ are very good, hardware was shit and it had a lot of missing electronics and cables. I decided to finish it and make it a proper workhorse with the electronics the frame work deserves.
## Trackmania Driving AI
I worked on a shitty ML driving AI for race games for a while. It learned to go fast on my own weird game. I want to test it in a real racing game.
## Building a Hyrib Kubernetes Cluster
I have bunch of Raspberry Pis [(That plural is WEIRD)](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pi#:~:text=noun%20(1),plural%20pis%5C%20%CB%88p%C4%ABz%20%5C). Essentially installing k3s and connecting it to the existing Kubernetes server I have. Seems easy, so I think it will not be a easy project.
## Obsidian Automatic Tag and Relation Generator
[Obsidian is a note taking and organizing application.](https://obsidian.md/) I want to create a tool for organizing my **Obsidian Vault**. I use something I learned in university called **L**ocality **S**ensitive **H**ashing. I think I can hack something together to detect some stuff for me.
## Stickerless Rubik's Connected
[Rubik's Connected](https://www.rubiks.com/en-eu/connected-cube) is a smart cube that you can connect to your phone/computer for many different applications. But it has stickers and I don't like stickers. I decided to 3d print replacement parts. I worked on this in 2021 for a very long time. It has some bugs but I believe I can get it working in 2022. Main problem is that very tiny 3d printed objects break very easily. I'll ditch 100% 3d printed approach and will epoxy-cast the mechanically important parts.
## Basic Stream Element Clone
[Stream Elements](https://streamelements.com/) seems a very easy product to re-implement, why there is no open source clones? BTW, fuck streamlabs.
# Learning Goals
## Learn How to Drive
Technically I know how to drive but I have rusted over the years and Norwegian Governments asks me to re-learn everything.
## Learn 3000 Norwegian Vocab
I don't know how I'm gonna measure this but I installed anki and duolingo, let's see.
## Learn Blender
As I mentioned I want to start a video game studio in near future. I have knowledge of how to program for video games, and I believe I'm a competent level designer. I suck at 3D Design. I decided to close that gap.
## Learn Nomad
Same goal as Blender but this is on iPad and uses brushes.
# Impossible List Items
[Insert Impossible List Explanation Here.](https://impossiblehq.com/impossible-list/)
## Write Blog post every week for a year
Nobody reads my blog but I use it as a training ground for creative writing even thought my writing is not creative at all. I'll work on this blog and my writing by practicing it every weak.
## Upload 12 Videos
There several examples of long running project logs on Youtube that achieved success. For example Wintergatan and Randy the GG engine. I want to 2022 as my testing ground to build such a following that I can dedicate my work hours to such a work. I don't think I will do that in 2022 but it is important to do it and learn in a small scale before I put in all of my chips.
## Stream 25 Times
I think most of the things I'm doing daily can be streamed. I'm a lonely man, If I can stream and create a community while doing my daily activities, I would be very happy. I'll try to do it but my hopes are not that high.
