The main difference is Transformers are designed with classification and distinct tokens and 3D animations work with continuous numbers. So It requires some conversion even before I can experiment and see whether it will work or not. I started working on this around last December on and off. I started with re-learning the basics and reading some papers on the topic. As the new year starts I decided to focus on it actively rather than beating around the bush.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought I must not be the only guy thinking of the same thing and I found there are some examples of conversion to work with time-series, and technically 3D animations are time series of composite angles. I found some examples online. Nothing was documented clearly but it can be a good point to start, if I can cut the corners I will since I only have 3 hours every day, more or less. I started with experimenting with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/maxjcohen/transformer&quot;&gt;the project that has the best documentation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the middle of the day, I realized they stripped out the parts I want to keep and added their own implementation. Then, I just realized I figured the same thing 2 months ago, too. Due to their implementation differences, my data was not fitting at all. After deciding, off-the-shelf implementations are not fitting me, I decided to do it myself. I revised my notes on the papers. Rather than re-implementing the transformer part of the code I used &lt;a href=&quot;http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html&quot;&gt;annoted version of “Attention is All You Need” paper&lt;/a&gt; as a starting ground. Of course, it came with its own problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My computer didn’t have a torch or anything installed because &lt;a href=&quot;/log/2021/12/12/what-i-learned-this-week-2021-49.html#tuesday&quot;&gt;last time I was trying to train anything,&lt;/a&gt; I tried to use WSL since I’m more familiar with Linux, it turns out it was a mistake. Long story short: if you install a special driver that gives you CUDA powers on WSL and if you have a G-SYNC enabled monitor connected some glitches cause horrible stuff like frame drops and intermittent green flashes. Even if WSL is not actively running, the problems continue. Rather than having system-wide problems, I decided to switch to windows’ python. Thus I needed to re-download and install everything from driver to torch package. It used an outdated version of PyTorch (which might not be outdated at the time of release) and it was not available for Windows, so I spent some time porting the code to the latest PyTorch version. Thankfully, it was straightforward and fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that wasted almost all the time I have for this week, I decided to adapt an old Facebook adage: “Move fast and break things.” I decided to convert just a tiny part of the code and try to run it. Of course, everything starts to give an error. So I fix those until everything is converted to work with numbers. I’m not done with that conversion cycle, yet. When it is ready we will see whether the theory will work or not.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Alchemistake</name><email>alchemistake@thrideas.com</email></author><category term="animation-transformer" /><category term="machine-learning" /><category term="code" /><summary type="html">So I have a theory that transformers can generate 3D Animations since language and animation are alike in many aspects.

&lt;p&gt;My main goal was to do something and produce a video about it every day without some overspill between days. So it meant I either managed to do it or everything I’ve worked on was thrown to do thrash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first couple of tries I worked on I tried to not care about recording a video before finishing what I’m trying to do. Then I quickly realized I could show something but it usually meant I was doing a very janky show and tell and there were a lot of context clues missing. So I decided to try recording while doing something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While trying to balance recording and progress on my side-projects I realized I still had context problems. For example, I tried to record &lt;a href=&quot;/productivity/2022/01/23/how-i-automated-buying-bitcoin-with-nodered.html&quot;&gt;BTC Bot blog post&lt;/a&gt; as a TikTok. Then after recording everything I realized I had never shown the before balance, and I couldn’t roll back the time so that video went into thrash as well. So before doing a step of the project I started to take a quick voiceless video, even though I didn’t think I have use for it as a safety net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day I was working on &lt;a href=&quot;/home-server/2021/11/28/a-makeshift-home-server.html&quot;&gt;my home-server&lt;/a&gt; to add external HDDs and electrical wiring for 12V components. I set up my phone with a ring light and it was easy to start recording at any moment. Then I realized I need my hands most of the time, especially when I’m cramped in my small storage room. I decided to use my tripod and mic arm to hold the phone hands free. That day I was laser-focused on getting the result I aimed for, I did not dedicate time to edit the videos at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after deciding how much time is enough time to edit videos for TikTok, I tried to plan the next day so it would be easier to shoot and edit. I decided to record a video about how to make your own hot end. At the 15 minute mark of recording I realized, I ordered the wrong part and there was no way to do the video I wanted. So I decided to add a preliminary check before I do anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, I decided to work on the &lt;a href=&quot;/productivity/2021/12/04/2022-plans-and-goals.html#3d-animation-generating-machine-learning-model&quot;&gt;animation generation project&lt;/a&gt;, I have been studying machine learning for. I didn’t want to start with the machine learning part so I decided to make a very basic animation that I can generate multiple copies of and will be useful in the long run and I can post it to TikTok. After every lesson, I learned by fire and I was able to produce &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@alchemistake/video/7058016195244592390&quot;&gt;this shit-terpiece&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love or hate it bitcoin is here and people invest in it. I like to invest a small amount of my wage in BTC and index funds to have a steady saving strategy. I watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XImly72tLw0&quot;&gt;a video from Thomas Frank about automatizing finance and saving up&lt;/a&gt; then I realized I should do the same. It was easy to automate buying funds and rainy day account via my bank but I wasn’t able to automate how to buy bitcoin via out of the box tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;issue-1-my-bank-does-not-do-recurring-payments-to-out-of-country&quot;&gt;Issue 1: My bank does not do recurring payments to out of country.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use Kraken to buy bitcoin which operates at Germany but I live in Norway. My bank does not do recurring payments for international money sending. I technically didn’t solved the problem but it is good enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realized that every 6 months I check in and decide what amount to invest. I decided to sit every 6 months and set up the payments manually. It takes almost 15 minutes to set up. Thus I do the verification and filling the form dance at once. Which wastes less time compared to manually sending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;issue-2-kraken-does-not-do-recurring-actions&quot;&gt;Issue 2: Kraken does not do recurring actions.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the bigger issue. Since I couldn’t set up buy actions in advance since I couldn’t predict prices and ranges &lt;em&gt;etc&lt;/em&gt;. But thankfully Kraken gives full access APIs. I decided to use my home server and Nodered to buy whenever money enters my Kraken account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I installed Nodered back when I decided to do some basic automations but I didn’t get around doing a useful one. When the problem arised, I was ready with my installed copy of Nodered waiting in my homeserver. I started with finding what should I do to talk with Kraken API. A quick google search showed a Nodered plugin called &lt;a href=&quot;https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-kraken&quot;&gt;node-red-contrib-kraken&lt;/a&gt;, which enables Nodered to talk with Kraken API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My algorithm is simple and stupid. Every day, I check my Kraken account’s Euro amount and if it is higher than 10€ I check the current price of BTC. Then I send a order with all of my money on the account. Due to some rounding errors and prices, I can have around 2-3€ after transaction. So I decided 10€ as the cut off point. I can do a better price calculation with some JS code but I’m currently lazy, maybe ill come around doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

To not break my 1 post-every-week of 2022 policy I decided to write about games I’m playing. I loaded up my Nintendo Switch with only 100MB to spare. I’ll try to cover almost 25 games during the holiday weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;spyro-reignited&quot;&gt;Spyro Reignited&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2022-01-02-mini-game-preview-mega-collection/1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;75%&quot; style=&quot;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;&quot; /&gt;
I was hyped about Spyro Remakes since I didn’t have Playstation 1 or 2 growing up and I always wanted to experience those games. I started playing the first game on the plane. I’m feeling a little conflicted with the game since it is owned by Activision but I trust Toys for Bob. I have an overclocked switch but it was a little bit laggy on some scenes. It might be due to SD card access speeds etc. but it still shouldn’t create graphical hiccups. The camera system soured the milk for me I couldn’t get used to it. I think the problem could be solved by a keymap like the new God of War game to enable better 2 stick control + actions. I’ll retry it on PC again later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;splatoon-2&quot;&gt;Splatoon 2&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2022-01-02-mini-game-preview-mega-collection/2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;75%&quot; style=&quot;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;&quot; /&gt;
Controls are cool but analog stick + motion control like BOTW is the better system. A good game is a good game. I’ll play online when I have the internet. It does not make sense offline that much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;cadence-of-hyrule&quot;&gt;Cadence of Hyrule&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2022-01-02-mini-game-preview-mega-collection/3.jpg&quot; width=&quot;75%&quot; style=&quot;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;&quot; /&gt;
After playing instruments for years I suck at this game. I did a lot I think it will be like my hollow knight story and ill love it when I come back to this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;big-brain-academy-brain-vs-brain&quot;&gt;Big Brain Academy: Brain vs Brain&lt;/h1&gt;

It is a good party game. I wouldn’t play this alone it is a very nice game to kill time until the food arrives. I will use it to kill time with my wife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;bayonetta&quot;&gt;Bayonetta&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2022-01-02-mini-game-preview-mega-collection/5.jpg&quot; width=&quot;75%&quot; style=&quot;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;&quot; /&gt;
First thing first: Menu blurs are reducing readability. Accessibility is a very important thing. Thankfully, it recovers from other aspects. I don’t have Wii U so switch port will be my first introduction. I know it is common to have this system in this genre of the game but the difficulty selection system is nice, chapter by chapter approach is granular enough and accessible for many.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the first intro was a cool part to have tutorials and let the people become familiar with the game but everything was moved to the actual intro and it had a long video part. It kind of killed the pace but it is a choice. Nothing bad!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no HP System but taking damage reduces end of chapter points. It is very cool to enjoy the game when you suck at hack and slashes.
No HP but punishing damages at the end is a good system for beginning hacks and slashers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Touch controls were unnecessary but cool for accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;inside&quot;&gt;Inside&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2022-01-02-mini-game-preview-mega-collection/6.jpg&quot; width=&quot;75%&quot; style=&quot;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;&quot; /&gt;
I find minimalist games weird. I loved the atmosphere of the game. The lack of features is a calculated trade-off for extreme polish. I noticed a lot of small things that are deliberately designed and put there for a reason. The graphical language and clues were clear. So every puzzle was just, you didn’t feel that game is not fair with the solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I could list the stuff I noticed but I don’t want to give spoilers. I want to keep the preview spoiler-free, this is a “test out the game” situation. You are not fed with the story you need to interpret stuff&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mondays are currently days for adding automation and optimizations to my workflow. Since I can only dedicate around 3 hours for my work because of a full-time job, I decided to dedicate a day in a week to remove time wastes from those 3 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;node-red&quot;&gt;Node-RED&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Node-RED is a block programming environment that enables you to do very high levels of automation. Essentially it is IFTTT on steroids. It has a learning curve but It does not require you to be a 10x Software Engineer. Thus you can program any automation using a little bit of elbow grease and blocks people already created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-do-i-want-to-learn-it&quot;&gt;Why do I want to learn it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started this blog and have been writing stuff on it for around two months now. I think I’m ready to reel in the people. I think I can set up some automation to send tweets and send the posts to relevant subreddits. I believe If I can figure out Node-RED, I can create any type of automation to fit my needs. Like home automation or controlling my 3D printer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-much-i-learned&quot;&gt;How much I learned&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to make an RSS listener that will send a tweet on my personal account whenever I post a blog message. It seems an easy enough task to achieve on a day. I started with installing Node-RED on my home server. I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/k8s-at-home/node-red&quot;&gt;k8s at home&lt;/a&gt; templates to install them swiftly. I had some troubles with the server, so it took a little bit longer than I expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to start with the “How to read RSS” part of the question. There was not an out-of-the-box solution but installing a plugin was easy enough. Then I struggled with input-output systems of Node-RED. It was easy but I was confused. After figuring it out I didn’t want to send spam tweets to my account. I decided to send myself emails to see whether everything works out or not. I installed another plugin. After setting up my email credentials, I realized a problem. There was no way of detecting new posts, It was sending emails for every post that exists when I deploy the automation. I ran out of time for that day, so I couldn’t debug why. I disabled sending emails part and then added debug blocks for the next time I do a check-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;tuesday&quot;&gt;Tuesday&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesdays are currently learning machine learning days!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;auto-encoder&quot;&gt;Auto Encoder&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Autoencoder is an unsupervised artificial neural network that learns how to efficiently compress and encode data then learns how to reconstruct the data back from the reduced encoded representation to a representation that is as close to the original input as possible.
Autoencoder, by design, reduces data dimensions by learning how to ignore the noise in the data.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://towardsdatascience.com/auto-encoder-what-is-it-and-what-is-it-used-for-part-1-3e5c6f017726&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-do-i-want-to-learn-it-1&quot;&gt;Why do I want to learn it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m working on a tool that requires 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; Input sizes. I thought maybe I can use Autoencoders to compress the data to the form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-much-i-learned-1&quot;&gt;How much I learned&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a Windows machine with a GPU installed. I don’t like Windows to develop stuff so I use something called WSL to have easy access and heavily integrated Linux virtual machine on top of Windows. This creates a problem with the GPU though. Windows and Linux have to have a special CUDA driver to share the GPU while running computation. I started by researching how can I install CUDA. It turns out it is only allowed on Windows 11 and Windows 10 Insiders Programme. For the uninitiated &lt;em&gt;Insiders&lt;/em&gt; is a hell hole you get stuck if you accidentally enable and everything is half broken and a half working all the time. It is a beta program but I don’t want to join again since there is no way to revert back. The article saying that was so old, I thought maybe the mainstream Win10 release got the features needed. So I decided to install the drivers that say only work on Windows 10 Insiders and they worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I used a very simple torch example code to train some autoencoders. I started by testing my assumptions. I believe if the size of the input is smaller than the compressed size then we should see 100% accuracy. Since you can just copy and paste the data to the compressed version. It worked with 100% Accuracy. Then I started testing with bigger data sizes. To test them rather than using an off-the-shelf dataset I decided to create randomized junk. When using totally random data accuracy fell to 80% then I started reading about it. The reason autoencoders can compress data is by learning the underlying structure of the data. If someone uses totally random data there will be no structure at all so 80% is not that bad. So I decided to continue with the experiments when I have the data set I want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;wednesday&quot;&gt;Wednesday&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;openwrt-vlan&quot;&gt;OpenWRT VLAN&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virtual Networks are basically an abstraction of the networks that enables you to divide your network into individual and isolated parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-do-i-want-to-learn-it-2&quot;&gt;Why do I want to learn it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to make a robust home network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-much-i-learned-2&quot;&gt;How much I learned&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that much actually. I started by following the official OpenWRT wiki. Then I realized I’m on a newer version of OpenWRT than the wiki gives explanation and they are not simply compatible at all. I started with experimentation and achieve little. I realized the setup I have complicates it a lot and decided to stop and experiment on an easier setup when the wikis are updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: I learned that I don’t know anything about OpenWRT yet. Played around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;longhorn&quot;&gt;Longhorn&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Longhorn is a lightweight, reliable, and powerful distributed block storage system for Kubernetes.
Longhorn implements distributed block storage using containers and microservices. Longhorn creates a dedicated storage controller for each block device volume and synchronously replicates the volume across multiple replicas stored on multiple nodes. The storage controller and replicas are themselves orchestrated using Kubernetes.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://longhorn.io/docs/1.2.2/&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-do-i-want-to-learn-it-3&quot;&gt;Why do I want to learn it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m planning to add more nodes to my Kubernetes cluster which in turn means I will need a more robust storage solution. I decided to try out longhorn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-much-i-learned-3&quot;&gt;How much I learned&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to follow some tutorials and installed them on my home server to test it out. From what I see it is a nice piece of software, but I feel like it does not fit the make-shift server structure I have. I suggest &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKBBHc0t7bc&quot;&gt;watching this video to get a clear and thorough preview&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;thursday&quot;&gt;Thursday&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;p3-steel&quot;&gt;P3 Steel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The P3Steel is a remix of Twelvepro’s redesign of Josef Prusa’s i3.
Leonardo - the prototype P3Steel printer - was designed and built by Irobri in April 2013, after attending a local Maker show in Zaragoza, Spain.
The main frame structure, built from laser-cut 3mm steel, is extremely strong and simple to assemble, and eliminates the need for several printed parts due to the use of steel parts instead of threaded rods for the “Y” subframe (as in the original Prusa i3 and many of its variants).&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://reprap.org/wiki/P3Steel&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-do-i-want-to-learn-it-4&quot;&gt;Why do I want to learn it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought a kit for P3 Steel back in 2018 for around 100$. The unbelievable price bit me in the arse multiple times after I realized the kit is half-built and lacks a lot of features. After buying and building Ender 3 V2, I decided to revive the P3 Steel Project since I believe It has a superior platform to Ender 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-much-i-learned-4&quot;&gt;How much I learned&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started with absorbing the information online to see and plan ahead what can I do to complete it. The main problem I have is cables are not long enough in many places. I decided to ignore it for this session since it involves buying something rather than building something. Other problems include Hotend being an old 2.85 mm standard that nobody uses anymore. After a little bit of tinkering, I realized this kit uses a clone E3D V5 hot end with many parts missing. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvICpdVONXM&quot;&gt;I decided to upgrade it using a DIY Guide I found online.&lt;/a&gt; I think this hidden gem is brilliant and shows how the hotends work brilliantly. After wasting 3 hours online shopping, I decided not to try that DIY guide. I decided to build it after learning a little bit more after building a clone of something that exists. I bought the parts for an E3D V6 hotend. It cost me around $10 because I was able to skip a lot of parts since I have some stuff lying around. I will create a high flow hotend for Ender 3 next, following the tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;friday&quot;&gt;Friday&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fridays are dedicated to my wife and gaming together. I didn’t learn anything that except I love &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/it-takes-two&quot;&gt;It Takes Two&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It seems an easy enough task to achieve on a day. I started with installing Node-RED on my home server. I used k8s at home templates to install them swiftly. I had some troubles with the server, so it took a little bit longer than I expected.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">2022 Plans and Goals</title><link href="https://alche.thrideas.com/productivity/2021/12/04/2022-plans-and-goals.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="2022 Plans and Goals" /><published>2021-12-04T20:15:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-12-04T20:15:00+01:00</updated><id>https://alche.thrideas.com/productivity/2021/12/04/2022-plans-and-goals</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://alche.thrideas.com/productivity/2021/12/04/2022-plans-and-goals.html">&lt;p&gt;I decided to make my goals public this year. I believe that would force me to achieve them. Even though 1 person reads this blog, my brain will be in the &lt;em&gt;get shit done&lt;/em&gt; mode. Psychology is a weird thing. Even if I don’t finish everything I listed, It is ok. As Machiavelli said&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Acting in this like the skilful archer, who seeing that the object he would hit is distant, and knowing the range of his bow, takes aim much above the destined mark; not designing that his arrow should strike so high, but that flying high it may alight at the point intended.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope I learn and have fun while doing so. I pretty much have same list for 3-4 years straight but I think this is the year I’ll say &lt;strong&gt;“This is Done!”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;project-plans&quot;&gt;Project Plans&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;nro2nsp-forwarder-in-the-nintendo-switch-itself&quot;&gt;NRO2NSP Forwarder in the Nintendo Switch Itself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wtf is that lumb of letters and number? If you don’t have a hacked switch they don’t make any sense but there is a commonly used tool that requires a Windows machine to set up. Essentially, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gbatemp.net/threads/nro2nsp-retroarch-rom-nro-forwarders.519915/&quot;&gt;NRO2NSP Forwarder&lt;/a&gt; is a home screen shortcuts for homebrew applications. While trying to setup my newly hacked switch, it generated a lot of headache for me and I decided to write this tool for switch itself. TLDR, It will be basic compiler for switch apps inside the Nintendo Switch itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;3d-animation-generating-machine-learning-model&quot;&gt;3D Animation Generating Machine Learning Model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For people unaware, I want to start a video game company for a long long time. I noticed that with small budgets, Indie game companies need to take loans against something to feed the team members. I tought I found a clever way to train a machine learning to design 3D Animations in bulk. Most probably, even if it creates nice animations, it will require human touch but I believe if a tool like this works it will cut a lot of cost and time. Little bit moonshot but I’m optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;finishing-my-3d-printer-kit-p3-steel&quot;&gt;Finishing my 3D Printer kit: P3 Steel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2018, I bought a 3D printer kit &lt;a href=&quot;https://reprap.org/wiki/P3Steel&quot;&gt;(Metal framed Prusa i3 MKI clone)&lt;/a&gt; for less than 100$. Even though the frame &lt;em&gt;etc.&lt;/em&gt; are very good, hardware was shit and it had a lot of missing electronics and cables. I decided to finish it and make it a proper workhorse with the electronics the frame work deserves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;trackmania-driving-ai&quot;&gt;Trackmania Driving AI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worked on a shitty ML driving AI for race games for a while. It learned to go fast on my own weird game. I want to test it in a real racing game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;building-a-hyrib-kubernetes-cluster&quot;&gt;Building a Hyrib Kubernetes Cluster&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have bunch of Raspberry Pis &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pi#:~:text=noun%20(1),plural%20pis%5C%20%CB%88p%C4%ABz%20%5C&quot;&gt;(That plural is WEIRD)&lt;/a&gt;. Essentially installing k3s and connecting it to the existing Kubernetes server I have. Seems easy, so I think it will not be a easy project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;obsidian-automatic-tag-and-relation-generator&quot;&gt;Obsidian Automatic Tag and Relation Generator&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://obsidian.md/&quot;&gt;Obsidian is a note taking and organizing application.&lt;/a&gt; I want to create a tool for organizing my &lt;strong&gt;Obsidian Vault&lt;/strong&gt;. I use something I learned in university called &lt;strong&gt;L&lt;/strong&gt;ocality &lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;ensitive &lt;strong&gt;H&lt;/strong&gt;ashing. I think I can hack something together to detect some stuff for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;stickerless-rubiks-connected&quot;&gt;Stickerless Rubik’s Connected&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rubiks.com/en-eu/connected-cube&quot;&gt;Rubik’s Connected&lt;/a&gt; is a smart cube that you can connect to your phone/computer for many different applications. But it has stickers and I don’t like stickers. I decided to 3d print replacement parts. I worked on this in 2021 for a very long time. It has some bugs but I believe I can get it working in 2022. Main problem is that very tiny 3d printed objects break very easily. I’ll ditch 100% 3d printed approach and will epoxy-cast the mechanically important parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;basic-stream-element-clone&quot;&gt;Basic Stream Element Clone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://streamelements.com/&quot;&gt;Stream Elements&lt;/a&gt; seems a very easy product to re-implement, why there is no open source clones? BTW, fuck streamlabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;learning-goals&quot;&gt;Learning Goals&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;learn-how-to-drive&quot;&gt;Learn How to Drive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically I know how to drive but I have rusted over the years and Norwegian Governments asks me to re-learn everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;learn-3000-norwegian-vocab&quot;&gt;Learn 3000 Norwegian Vocab&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know how I’m gonna measure this but I installed anki and duolingo, let’s see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;learn-blender&quot;&gt;Learn Blender&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned I want to start a video game studio in near future. I have knowledge of how to program for video games, and I believe I’m a competent level designer. I suck at 3D Design. I decided to close that gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;learn-nomad&quot;&gt;Learn Nomad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same goal as Blender but this is on iPad and uses brushes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;impossible-list-items&quot;&gt;Impossible List Items&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://impossiblehq.com/impossible-list/&quot;&gt;Insert Impossible List Explanation Here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;write-blog-post-every-week-for-a-year&quot;&gt;Write Blog post every week for a year&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody reads my blog but I use it as a training ground for creative writing even thought my writing is not creative at all. I’ll work on this blog and my writing by practicing it every weak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;upload-12-videos&quot;&gt;Upload 12 Videos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There several examples of long running project logs on Youtube that achieved success. For example Wintergatan and Randy the GG engine. I want to 2022 as my testing ground to build such a following that I can dedicate my work hours to such a work. I don’t think I will do that in 2022 but it is important to do it and learn in a small scale before I put in all of my chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;stream-25-times&quot;&gt;Stream 25 Times&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think most of the things I’m doing daily can be streamed. I’m a lonely man, If I can stream and create a community while doing my daily activities, I would be very happy. I’ll try to do it but my hopes are not that high.&lt;/p&gt;

But I’m sure for every hi-end home server there is 2 makeshift home servers. I decided to share mine to show that you don’t need to have space for Rack mounted 2000-3000$ Home Server setup. You just need something that satisfies your home computation needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;base-machine&quot;&gt;Base Machine&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started using my 2014 Macbook Pro as the Home Server when my work provided me a new laptop in 2018. It served me nice but the poor laptop was struggling when I was trying to use it for anything. I re-installed MacOs and Docker to get started. I was only using plex and some minimal stuff so that setup was working quite nice. But the overhead of a graphical user interface and MacOs’s poor remote access features pushed me over the edge. I decided to convert everything to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alchemistake/my-home-kluster&quot;&gt;Linux and Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; since It is the easiest thing to manage for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2021-11-28-a-makeshift-home-server/ssd_converter.jpg&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; style=&quot;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;&quot; /&gt;
I upgraded the internal storage to 1 TB. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01CWWAENG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&quot;&gt;I bought one of NVMe to Macbook SSD converters&lt;/a&gt;, I poured bunch of time for research, more than necessary. You need to buy the correct converter for your own mac, most of the stuff online are garbage don’t take my choice as gospel. There are very detailed guides. They are not that good for daily use, &lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt; they require re-flashing some chips &lt;em&gt;etc.&lt;/em&gt; But to use it on Linux and as a server I just needed to plug everything in and then puff it worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;networking&quot;&gt;Networking&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My laptop stays in a metal shelf and wifi signal is very poor. For a long time I used a USB wifi card with a long USB cable to it outside of the faraday cage of doom. But then I realized USB Wifi cards does not provide good enough connection speeds. &lt;a href=&quot;/home-server/2021/11/06/a-peculiar-case-of-a-home-networking.html&quot;&gt;So I installed a full fledged Wifi Router as the externel network card. I won’t go into details because I already wrote some stuff for that.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;nas--harddisks&quot;&gt;NAS &amp;amp; Harddisks&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2021-11-28-a-makeshift-home-server/hdd_cage.jpg&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; style=&quot;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;&quot; /&gt;
I decided to add more storage and add NAS Capability. I bought two of 5 Drive Cage for that. I shucked my external HDDs that I have laying around. I own too much external HDDs. I decided to use USB hubs I collected over the years to connect them to my Macbook. This is not a perfect solution at all but since my base machine is a Macbook this is one the only solutions I can use. It will not be the best but it will be at least good enough for my use case. I’m connecting to this device over Wifi so I can handle slower connection speeds on HDDs since wifi will be the bottleneck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2021-11-28-a-makeshift-home-server/smol_hdd.jpg&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; style=&quot;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;&quot; /&gt;
I had several smol HDDs from smol external HDDs. Rather than buying a 2.5 to 3.5 converter, I decided to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:606950&quot;&gt;3D print this design&lt;/a&gt;. This design was very fast to print but after using them for a while I see that they are not eligible for the job. The print orientation and the placement of the 2.5 HDDs makes it impossible to stack them inside of the 5 Bay cage. I’ll redesign something very soon, but they are good enough now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I needed a PSU for the all the HDDs I’m going to add. I was going to upgrade my desktop’s PSU so I decided to pull that upgrade little bit closer and used my old PSU and upgraded my computer’s PSU. I used a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4001358646207.html&quot;&gt;PSU power breakout board&lt;/a&gt; to have easy access to the different voltages. I’ll add a variable power converter to achive a 9V and 19.5V line in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;sum-of-all-parts&quot;&gt;Sum of all Parts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2021-11-28-a-makeshift-home-server/sum_of_parts.jpg&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; style=&quot;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;&quot; /&gt;
Since everything was loose parts around I decided to screw everything to a board I had from a broken Lack Table. I needed to shorted the board to make it fit inside of the shelving unit I have. It took around 5 Minutes. I hot glued the USB hub and Wifi Router. I used hot glue because it is strong enough to hold a USB hub and removable. I didn’t want to use hot glue for the Wifi Router but the wall mount holes were too small for any screw I had so I just used hot glue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To mount the HDD Cages I needed to drill big hole on top to pass the screw driver. It was not a big time waster. When that was ready I placed down a sheet of old bicycle inner tube I had since 2017 when I fucked up a bicycle ride. This will act like a vibration dampener. If you are still using bicycle inner tubes I suggest you hold on to the old ones. They are very handy insulator and elastic material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2021-11-28-a-makeshift-home-server/psu.jpg&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; style=&quot;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;&quot; /&gt;
I didn’t want to use hot glue for everything though. Since everything that was mountable was mounted, I decided to use 3D Printed Brackets. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1869903&quot;&gt;I used this ATX PSU Bracket&lt;/a&gt;. It is not the mechanically best part, but it was the fastest to print. I designed a simple L shape to hold the macbook in place. Thus most of the stuff were ready.
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2021-11-28-a-makeshift-home-server/l_bracket.jpg&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; style=&quot;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything plugs in to a UPS I had since college that can handle up to 500W. If electricity goes out, I will hold everything up to 15 minutes. It is not a long time for UPS but It is a long time to detect Power Outage and shutdown everything safely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;farewell&quot;&gt;Farewell!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is still not 100% Complete but I wanted to give a voice to the jank setups that exists. As you can notice most of the parts were stuff I already owned and repurposed, don’t hesitate to repurpose your old junk! In future, I’ll work on cable management and adding Raspberry Pis into the mix. Currently, I have problems with software more than hardware I think I’ll focus on that front more.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;New York Times bestselling author Janice Kaplan examines the phenomenon of luck–and discovers the exciting ways you can grab opportunities and make luck for yourself every day.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;After spending a year researching and experiencing gratitude for The Gratitude Diaries, Janice Kaplan is back to tackle another big, mysterious influence in all our lives: luck. And this time she’s joined on her journey by coauthor Dr. Barnaby Marsh, a renowned academic who guides her exploration.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/35749437-how-luck-happens&quot;&gt;goodreads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;why-im-reading-this-book&quot;&gt;Why I’m reading this book?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last year, I have been using Blinkist free tier for discovering books I might like. This book caught my eyes or to be more correct my ears. I decided to give it a go to read the whole book. The book tries to explain the luck and what it is in layman’s terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;which-parts-ive-finished&quot;&gt;Which parts I’ve finished?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;50 pages are exactly the first part and first three chapters. So in this preview, I’ll be spoiling the first chapter a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;did-i-learn-something-new&quot;&gt;Did I learn something new?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I didn’t learn something new but this book helped me put a new perspective on the stuff I already knew. The authors talk about luck in perspective to statistics and analytic data. Due to my college education and profession, I am exposed to those topics very much. But due to the classic case of horse blinders, it never occurred to me these informations can be applied to life directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;did-i-like-something&quot;&gt;Did I like something?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luck is a random event you won’t know when will it happen but you can prepare for these random events. If you are not prepared for &lt;strong&gt;the lucky event&lt;/strong&gt; you will miss your chances. &lt;em&gt;For example,&lt;/em&gt; if you are a musician, and you want someone to discover you. You should keep a copy of your work on you. If they are willing to give it a go, they will be able to give it a go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The classic Wayne Gretzky quote: “You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take.”. Continuing with the musician example; you see someone can open the doors for you. If you don’t even ask for an audience from them, you won’t get discovered. It is not rude if you keep things respectful and don’t show down your work down somebody’s throat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very generalized statistics are bullshit. When the statistics are generalized to a single number they don’t mean anything and they don’t apply to you at all. For example, 13% of people are obese. But there are almost millions of “input dimensions”, different factors that change the outcome. When you use only a single number then you are eliminating everything that provides some sort of information. If you want to weigh the possibility of something, you need to find the distribution on your input dimensions. For example, if you include family history, chronic diseases, etc. and just look at the distribution of obese people that fit your description the change might become 80% or 1%. The 13% does not mean anything to you. Nobody is average, everyone is unique. Try to use statistics that fit you better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other side of the coin of luck is &lt;strong&gt;risk&lt;/strong&gt;. If you are lucky you will achieve something, if you are not you will lose something. This is the basic explanation of taking risks. So taking risks is not always the biggest gain, biggest loss game. You can foresee somewhat accurate expected gain vs expected loss. So taking risks on low loss, big gain situations are the best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes big gains are not even necessary. You can either spend your time on big results and a 1 in million chance or very frequent small gains. Which one will be more profitable for you is your call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;do-i-recommend-it&quot;&gt;Do I recommend it?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend this book! The text of the book is not that science/statistics heavy, but they explain the concepts in an understandable manner and it is appliable to real life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;will-i-continue-reading&quot;&gt;Will I continue Reading?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will continue reading it to the other cover. It is not that thick so I believe I can finish it very fast.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Alchemistake</name><email>alchemistake@thrideas.com</email></author><category term="books" /><category term="50pages" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">One of those weeks</title><link href="https://alche.thrideas.com/home-server/2021/11/14/one-of-those-weeks.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="One of those weeks" /><published>2021-11-14T17:46:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-11-14T17:46:00+01:00</updated><id>https://alche.thrideas.com/home-server/2021/11/14/one-of-those-weeks</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://alche.thrideas.com/home-server/2021/11/14/one-of-those-weeks.html">&lt;p&gt;I’m having one of those weeks. I was planning to finish my homeserver that has the parts sitting on the shelf and then wave of bad luck hit my project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a small VLAN problem with my home server. My TV couldn’t find my plex server. Also I have a Wake On LAN server to start my computer from long distance in case I want to do something like download a game in advance or start a backup. The problem was &lt;a href=&quot;/home-server/2021/11/06/a-peculiar-case-of-a-home-networking.html&quot;&gt;the router setup I did last week&lt;/a&gt; was not sharing same LAN. So I wanted to setup a new networking with proper VLANs and dividing the network into purpose built VLANs like smart devices, server, home usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s where all started. I tested a lot of stuff they didn’t work as I intended then I decided to revert the settings changes and just have single shared pool of IPs which would solve the problem but wouldn’t give me granular access I wanted. No big deal, to be honest. Then fire nation attacked! Since both of the routers use OpenWRT they look identical. I accidentally installed the back up of the secondary router to the primary router which destroyed everything I worked. Plus, since configurations are drastically different the internet was gone for a while. Thankfully I had another router laying around at house so I quickly connected that while recovering the state of the both routers to work together. This whole failed operation took around 10 hours of my free time which de-railed my whole week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I couldn’t finish other parts of the server, thus parts are still in my shelf and sitting until I dedicate more time to do them. I hope It does not turn in to one of these weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prevent this problem happening again I installed a theme to main router I own thus they look different, you can find &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jerrykuku/luci-theme-argon&quot;&gt;the sexy theme I used here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This derailed everything for this week, I didn’t do the stuff I wanted to do but all is well. I learned a lot about OpenWRT, VLANs and networking.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Alchemistake</name><email>alchemistake@thrideas.com</email></author><category term="home-server" /><category term="networking" /><summary type="html">I’m having one of those weeks.

I’ll run through I have configured my server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my current house we have the internet port in the middle of the living room and I wanted to have the server in the small storage closet the other side of the house. Directly they are about 8 meters or so apart. Which can be done with an ethernet cable but due to sliding doors there is no way to route them without disabling the door from opening and closing. So I looked into getting powerline ethernet connections, I realized that there is multiple extension cords in between which reduces the effectiveness of these type of adapters. I decided to use a USB Wifi adapter to get some internet. I used this solution for a while then I realized using 2.4 GHz Wifi is slow for some of my use cases. For example, backing up my computer (~3TB) takes exteremely long and for some odd reason clogs all the other connections on my local network. Which prevents my wife from doing anything online. Rather than buying another and more powerful USB Wifi adapter, I decided to go with a cheapskate route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found an “AC1200” router which supports OpenWRT for little to none. OpenWRT (&lt;strong&gt;Open&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;b&gt;W&lt;/b&gt;ireless &lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;ou&lt;b&gt;T&lt;/b&gt;er) is an open source router operating system that unlocks a lot of features that router companies are lazy to enable. AC1200 stands for combined speed of Wifi 5 mode and Wifi 4 mode (867 + 300 ~= 1200 Mbps).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openwrt.org/toh/netgear/r6120&quot;&gt;I installed OpenWRT following official OpenWRT tutorial.&lt;/a&gt; Then I set it up to connect to main router of my house using Wifi 5, Which will provide faster speed than both Wifi 4 and Powerline adapter. TLDR; I essentially bought another router and spend some time to convert it to a wifi adapter. This might seem overkill for now but let me justify myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/3d-printing/2021/10/10/ultimate-guide-to-octo4a.html&quot;&gt;I have Octo4a running on a phone&lt;/a&gt;. I want to isolate it from my main network to reduce security risks. So I set up Wifi 4 antenna to create a second Wifi SSID to just handle Octo4a and the smart power strip I use to power up/down my 3d printer. Also I wanted to have it connection to local area network even if power goes down. I added an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) for the router. Thus In case of emergency I can run a automation to make it safe when power comes back. 3D printers are dangerous devices I don’t want to start a fire by accident in the case of power surge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second reason: I have a plan to include all of my Raspberry Pies I own as a extension of the server to offload the work. Thus having a shared LAN interface will be very useful. I could’ve setup a LAN interface without a router but I’m lazy and this was the path of least resistance with maximum reliability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So If any of you want to hack me here is the diagram of the setup:
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2021-11-06-a-peculiar-case-of-a-home-networking/diagram.png&quot; style=&quot;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tested various different setups and it seems like this is the next best option compated to a physical cable. If you are not able to run a ethernet cable to somewhere it might be a good idea to use this 2 routers approach then. I hope this will help somebody!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Alchemistake</name><email>alchemistake@thrideas.com</email></author><category term="home-server" /><category term="networking" /><summary type="html">I have a very unique and weird home server setup, I believe it will be interesting to tell about it.
