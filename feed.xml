I’ll run through I have configured my server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my current house we have the internet port in the middle of the living room and I wanted to have the server in the small storage closet the other side of the house. Directly they are about 8 meters or so apart. Which can be done with an ethernet cable but due to sliding doors there is no way to route them without disabling the door from opening and closing. So I looked into getting powerline ethernet connections, I realized that there is multiple extension cords in between which reduces the effectiveness of these type of adapters. I decided to use a USB Wifi adapter to get some internet. I used this solution for a while then I realized using 2.4 GHz Wifi is slow for some of my use cases. For example, backing up my computer (~3TB) takes exteremely long and for some odd reason clogs all the other connections on my local network. Which prevents my wife from doing anything online. Rather than buying another and more powerful USB Wifi adapter, I decided to go with a cheapskate route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found an “AC1200” router which supports OpenWRT for little to none. OpenWRT (&lt;strong&gt;Open&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;b&gt;W&lt;/b&gt;ireless &lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;ou&lt;b&gt;T&lt;/b&gt;er) is an open source router operating system that unlocks a lot of features that router companies are lazy to enable. AC1200 stands for combined speed of Wifi 5 mode and Wifi 4 mode (867 + 300 ~= 1200 Mbps).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openwrt.org/toh/netgear/r6120&quot;&gt;I installed OpenWRT following official OpenWRT tutorial.&lt;/a&gt; Then I set it up to connect to main router of my house using Wifi 5, Which will provide faster speed than both Wifi 4 and Powerline adapter. TLDR; I essentially bought another router and spend some time to convert it to a wifi adapter. This might seem overkill for now but let me justify myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/3d-printing/2021/10/10/ultimate-guide-to-octo4a.html&quot;&gt;I have Octo4a running on a phone&lt;/a&gt;. I want to isolate it from my main network to reduce security risks. So I set up Wifi 4 antenna to create a second Wifi SSID to just handle Octo4a and the smart power strip I use to power up/down my 3d printer. Also I wanted to have it connection to local area network even if power goes down. I added an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) for the router. Thus In case of emergency I can run a automation to make it safe when power comes back. 3D printers are dangerous devices I don’t want to start a fire by accident in the case of power surge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second reason: I have a plan to include all of my Raspberry Pies I own as a extension of the server to offload the work. Thus having a shared LAN interface will be very useful. I could’ve setup a LAN interface without a router but I’m lazy and this was the path of least resistance with maximum reliability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So If any of you want to hack me here is the diagram of the setup:
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2021-11-06-a-peculiar-case-of-a-home-networking/diagram.png&quot; style=&quot;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tested various different setups and it seems like this is the next best option compated to a physical cable. If you are not able to run a ethernet cable to somewhere it might be a good idea to use this 2 routers approach then. I hope this will help somebody!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Alchemistake</name><email>alchemistake@thrideas.com</email></author><category term="home-server" /><category term="networking" /><summary type="html">I have a very unique and weird home server setup, I believe it will be interesting to tell about it.

I play too much Vidya Gaems. It is not a problem when I play a narative based single player game for fun but when I play something even remotely competitive I become a grustle focused Sigma. I can sink in 6-7 hours easily. Which turns my daily schedule upside down, and has a negative effect in my life. I’m playing until 2AM-3AM in the morning which makes me tired all day long. This gotta stop but I lack the willpower to not to do so. So I’ll delegate willpower to a computer program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;research&quot;&gt;Research&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my main concern is to have 60 minutes everyday to play. I can decrease or increase based on the circumstances. There is 4 options I considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;diy&quot;&gt;DIY&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a feature of windows called “policy”. You can setup those to block some certain applications from running. With some basic scripting I would be able to do it. It is free but hard to setup. If you are cash stripped it can be done. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.technipages.com/prevent-users-from-running-certain-programs&quot;&gt;You can continue your researche here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cold-turkey&quot;&gt;Cold Turkey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the defacto app blocker when you ask for an app blocker. Everyone knows it, everyone loves it. It has the time blocking power and it is called “allowance”. I didn’t buy it before because I believed it was a subscription based pricing. In my opinion, I find it very stupid to pay something only runs locally. It is 35$, I believe it is a honest price for an application you would use for a very long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;freedom&quot;&gt;Freedom&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freedom is the other best option. Has the functionality of the cold turkey and also provides syncing across devices. Since I’m not looking for a general app blocker I wasn’t interested in syncing across multiple devices. It has a subscription but In this case subscription is justified. If you get Yearly or Forever I believe it is a good value. Forever is too much expensive but it is equal to almost 5 years of yearly subscription.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;others&quot;&gt;Others&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://alternativeto.net/&quot;&gt;Alternative to&lt;/a&gt; website there is nine gazillion blockers available. Most of them are on/off switches, which is okay if it is what you are looking. Some of them are just browser extensions. &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/leechblock-ng/blaaajhemilngeeffpbfkdjjoefldkok&quot;&gt;Leech Block&lt;/a&gt; is a nice option for a just browser blocking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;selection&quot;&gt;Selection&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to go with Cold Turkey! Freedom and DIY options are nice but they have huge cons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DIY option is free in respect to money but it would be a lot of time dedicated to get it working. And when It breaks down I need to fix it. I didn’t want to have a project, I needed a tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freedom is a nice option but I don’t need its extra bells and whistles. Thus it just becomes too expensive for my use case. If I want to unify my blocking softwares I think it worths the money on yearly account. I would test for a year and then buy the forever account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;setup&quot;&gt;Setup&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I acquired the software I needed to setup my block settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;time-and-allowance-setup&quot;&gt;Time and Allowance Setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set up 00:00 to 00:00 block times in the weekdays and same hours for weekend. First block has 1 hour time allowance and the second block has 2 hours time allowance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2021-11-05-fixing-my-game-addiction/weekdays.png&quot; alt=&quot;Weekdays&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Weekdays Setup&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2021-11-05-fixing-my-game-addiction/weekend.png&quot; alt=&quot;Weekend&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Weekend Setup&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;blocking-apps-setup&quot;&gt;Blocking Apps Setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cold Turkey allow two types of block detection, one is direct &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.exe&lt;/code&gt; files, other is detecting &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.exe&lt;/code&gt; files on a folder. I suggest folder detection because sometimes games and launchers launch different &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.exe&lt;/code&gt; files then the one you have launched. I disabled Epic Games Store, Steam and Uplay.
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2021-11-05-fixing-my-game-addiction/apps.png&quot; alt=&quot;Weekend&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;problems&quot;&gt;Problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a strange reason Uplay creates a lot of notifications when it get’s blocked. I think it might be just me having this problem but I think it can be solved by muting Cold Turkey notifications. Definitely Uplay is doing something problematic, it is not a Cold Turkey issue.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bullshit Jobs: A Theory&lt;/em&gt; is a 2018 book by anthropologist David Graeber that postulates the existence of meaningless jobs and analyzes their societal harm. He contends that over half of societal work is pointless, and becomes psychologically destructive when paired with a work ethic that associates work with self-worth.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs&quot;&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came across with the book a while back but I never had the time to read it. I have just finished my first 50 pages and I think it is time for a pause and evaluate the content of this book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book is a extension of a essay author had written back in 2013. I have known about this theory since the essay was out. Due to my prior experiences with workplaces and seeing many people with so called bullshit jobs, The essay resonated with me &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe the book is not cutting it though. I didn’t like the repetitive nature of the book (at least in the first 50 pages). In the essay, it is more to the point and author explains the idea in very precise form. This quick and precises approach comes with the lack of evidence or convincing. In the book, author decides to take care of evidence and tries to be more convincing. He collected vast amount of data from the people who claim they have/had a bullshit job. He gives very many and varied anectodes to prove the point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt like this hurt the book in the short run. I decided to put down the book and not comeback. I was already sold to the idea and reading the book got boring very quick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As my final verdict, I suggest people to read &lt;a href=&quot;atlasofplaces.com/essays/on-the-phenomenon-of-bullshit-jobs/&quot;&gt;the essay&lt;/a&gt; first, then depending on the view point of yours the next steps vary. If you already agree with the essay you might skip the book but I heard the book has more content down the line like solutions to the this phenomenon. If you can’t stomach very repetitive parts, you can skip the first a few chapters to get the new points compared to the essay. If you don’t agree with the essay at all, go surf &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/&quot;&gt;the anti-work subreddit&lt;/a&gt; to prime yourself.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Alchemistake</name><email>alchemistake@thrideas.com</email></author><category term="books" /><category term="50pages" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Ultimate Guide to Octo4a</title><link href="https://alche.thrideas.com/3d-printing/2021/10/10/ultimate-guide-to-octo4a.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Ultimate Guide to Octo4a" /><published>2021-10-10T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2021-10-10T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>https://alche.thrideas.com/3d-printing/2021/10/10/ultimate-guide-to-octo4a</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://alche.thrideas.com/3d-printing/2021/10/10/ultimate-guide-to-octo4a.html">&lt;p&gt;The great person Gina Häußge created the Octoprint project, that allows you to control and monitor every aspect of your 3D printer and your printing jobs right from within your browser. People usually load it on a Raspberry Pi to use it but that is not the only way of using Octoprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have an old android phone laying around somewhere, Octo4a can be free solution rather than buying a Raspberry Pi. This option requires some setup to get it work but it is not unlike Raspberry Pi option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guide will show you how to setup your android device to act like a server for your 3D printer. It is not hard to install a few apps to get it working but I saw some people had questions and problems &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.me/octo4achat&quot;&gt;on the community&lt;/a&gt;. I’ll cover how to setup your device properly to make life easier and secure. I wont’ cover the hardware setup solution, It is very different from phone to phone but essentially you need to find a way to use any USB adapter and the charge at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;preparation&quot;&gt;Preparation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start the setup, you should factory reset or install a custom rom from scratch to clean up your phone. Thus your phone will not use any extra resource to other applications left over from previous use case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;octo4a-10&quot;&gt;Octo4a 1.0!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the official release of the Octo4a 1.0, everything has been changed! With new foundation new version is not compatible with direct update. If you are a old user of Octo4a, I strongly suggest you to backup the current installation before you start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/feelfreelinux/octo4a/releases&quot;&gt;Octo4a Github Page&lt;/a&gt; and download the latest release. If you never sideloaded an APK file before &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidauthority.com/how-to-install-apks-31494/&quot;&gt;you can follow this guide on Android Authority to learn&lt;/a&gt;. Long story short, you say OK or Yes when there is a prompt on screen. &lt;strong&gt;Quick security reminder: Don’t install any APKs you don’t trust.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After APK installation you need to install Octoprint. This is usually as straight forward as clicking a button! If anything weird happens try to uninstall the application and then re-install the APK and retry Octoprint installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are coming from an old installation, this is the time you use your backup. After restoring you need to change serial ports to include &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/dev/ttyOcto4a&lt;/code&gt; and clean the black list below.
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2021-10-10-ultimate-guide-to-octo4a/port.png&quot; alt=&quot;Port Setup&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are brand new user, you can connect to octoprint UI with typing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/find-ip-address-mobile-smartphone/&quot;&gt;your phones ip&lt;/a&gt; followed by &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:5000&lt;/code&gt; into any browser. Example: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://192.168.1.255:5000/&lt;/code&gt;. You can follow the setup screen there to setup your device. If you are having problems finding the IP of your phone, you can use the browser on the phone you just setup. Just go to address &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://localhost:5000/&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;camera-setup&quot;&gt;Camera Setup&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should try out newly revamped built-in camera! It solved a lot of problems from previous Octo4a release. But due to the vast majority of different phones in the market, it sometimes has some problems or overheats the phone. I have a overheating problem due to my phone’s other hardware problem, so I like to use another 3rd part webcam solution. If you had any problems with built-in camera solution. I suggest using app called IP Webcam. You can install via &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pas.webcam&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;gl=US&quot;&gt;Google Play&lt;/a&gt; or use a trusted APK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggest these settings on IP Webcam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Video Preferences/Video Resolution: 1280x720, 720p is enough.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Video Preferences/Focus Mode: Smooth, for recording video.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Power Management/Stop Camera: Disabled.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Power Management/Deactivate Display: Enabled.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Power Management/Keep Screen Active: Disabled.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Power Management/Shallow Sleep: Enabled.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Power Management/Stream on Device Boot: Enabled.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Audio Mode: Disabled.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Optional Permissions/Allow Streaming in Background: Enabled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you choose to use a 3rd part Camera Application you need to update the camera settings on Octoprint UI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2021-10-10-ultimate-guide-to-octo4a/webcam.png&quot; alt=&quot;Port Setup&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;out-of-home-access&quot;&gt;Out of Home Access&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to suggest ZeroTier for accessing your server when you are out of your home. This is a bit of a life style change but if you install ZeroTier to every device you own, you can securely access everything from everywhere. ZeroTier acts like a virtual LAN so your devices think you are connected to same modem essentially. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerotier.com/download/&quot;&gt;You can go to ZeroTier Website to learn how to set it up.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now rather than using your phone’s local IP, you should use Zerotier IP of the phone. For example update the camera settings to use Zerotier IP. You can find out the IP via going inside the app and Clicking at the network name and the IP will be in the managed IP list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2021-10-10-ultimate-guide-to-octo4a/zerotier0.png&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/2021-10-10-ultimate-guide-to-octo4a/zerotier1.png&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;remote-access-to-android&quot;&gt;Remote Access to Android&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an open source remote access app called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bk138/droidVNC-NG&quot;&gt;Droid VNC-NG&lt;/a&gt;. If you install this app to your phone you don’t have to physical access to the phone anymore. You can connect with a VNC Client to control your phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installation and setting this application is very straight forward. You can go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bk138/droidVNC-NG&quot;&gt;Droid VNC-NG’s Github Page&lt;/a&gt; to download and install the APK. The app will walk you through the installation. You are pretty much done with this setup except one catch. You should enable double tap to wake up feature of your phone! Whenever you connect to your phone with this application you will connect to a black screen, since your phone is locked you need to be able to unlock it. Double tap solves this since you can send a double tap through DroidVNC-NG. You can enable this via Settings/Display/Tap to Wake: Enabled.

&lt;p&gt;Now, You can use any VNC Client Application to access android portion of your setup to tweak in the future. I suggest VNC Viewer on Windows, iOS, Android and Remmina on Linux systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you want send a new version of APK or install something new on the phone level you might want to have a easy way to send files over. FTP Server app will create a &lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt;ile &lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;ransfer &lt;strong&gt;P&lt;/strong&gt;rotocol Server on your phone. Now you can use any FTP Client on your main devices. FileZilla is one of the most common FTP Client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get FTP Server on &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.xnano.android.ftpserver&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;gl=US&quot;&gt;Google Play&lt;/a&gt; or use a Trusted APK file. There is very similar apps with very similar names. Whichever one works on your phone is fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;robust-backup-system&quot;&gt;Robust Backup System&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing is forever. If your phone breaks down or something happens to octo4a files, it is hustle to set up a new instance from strach. Therefore everyone in earth needs to backup everything. There is a magical 2 step process that makes backups automatic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First Step: You should install this Octoprint plugin called &lt;a href=&quot;https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/backupscheduler/&quot;&gt;Backup Scheduler&lt;/a&gt; This will backup your octoprint settings and plugins automatically to the your device. But saving to your device is not enough. You need to put your backups outside of the device itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second Step: There is this app called &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dk.tacit.android.foldersync.lite&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;gl=US&quot;&gt;Folder Sync&lt;/a&gt; that I love! You can install and the follow instructions on the app to connect it to huge list of cloud storage providers. Then you can create a Folder pair to upload your backups to those could storage providers. Here is my settings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sync type: to Remote Folder.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Local Folder: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.octo4a/files/.octoprint/data/backup&lt;/code&gt; This folder location might be different for you depending on where you installed your Octo4a app. Try to find a folder called &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Android&lt;/code&gt; and then follow the rest of the path from there.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scheduled sync is enabled.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Schedule is every 12 hours. 24 is ok but I’m paranoid.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I disabled notifications.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rest of the setup is default.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technically you can install &lt;a href=&quot;https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/googledrivebackup/&quot;&gt;Google Drive access directly inside the Octoprint&lt;/a&gt; but it required more setup and fiddling than installing the android application. If that version works and easier for you please notify me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;optional-tasker&quot;&gt;(Optional) Tasker&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to my phone being half fried, signals drops randomly. Thus whenever Wifi drops, I need to re-enable my Camera and ZeroTier apps all the time. To automate this part I installed Tasker to re-enable them automatically whenever they are disconnected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve this I installed Tasker, IP Webcam Pro, and AutoInput. IP Webcam Pro has tasker integration so I can enable camera with that integration. AutoInput is used for opening ZeroTier App and flicking the enable disable button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If people are insterested I can write another post about Tasker and how to set that up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;future-extensions&quot;&gt;Future Extensions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;klipper&quot;&gt;Klipper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never used klipper, so i didn’t tried to get it done. It seems like people are having some problems but I have 100% everything will iron out in short time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-spagetti-detective&quot;&gt;The Spagetti Detective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to get TSD working. It didn’t I really don’t know why. But I don’t need it right now so I’m just calling it a day. I think the problem is with my TSD server so I will address that later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;automized-deployment&quot;&gt;Automized Deployment.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I have a high chance of my phone dying in a year or so and usually I’m lazy to setup everything manually. I believe I can cobble together a Ansible like program to install all the applications mentioned and even do the initial setup of them. I’m not doing it right now but wait until my phone breaks down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading. Posts worth less if you don’t tell me how you feel about this content!

People usually load it on a Raspberry Pi to use it but that is not the only way of using Octoprint. If you have an old android phone laying around somewhere, Octo4a can be free solution rather than buying a Raspberry Pi. This option requires some setup to get it work but it is not unlike Raspberry Pi option. This guide will show you how to setup your android device to act like a server for your 3D printer. It is not hard to install a few apps to get it working but I saw some people had questions and problems on the community. I’ll cover how to setup your device properly to make life easier and secure. I wont’ cover the hardware setup solution, It is very different from phone to phone but essentially you need to find a way to use any USB adapter and the charge at the same time. Preparation To start the setup, you should factory reset or install a custom rom from scratch to clean up your phone. Thus your phone will not use any extra resource to other applications left over from previous use case. Octo4a 1.0! With the official release of the Octo4a 1.0, everything has been changed! With new foundation new version is not compatible with direct update. If you are a old user of Octo4a, I strongly suggest you to backup the current installation before you start. Go to Octo4a Github Page and download the latest release. If you never sideloaded an APK file before you can follow this guide on Android Authority to learn. Long story short, you say OK or Yes when there is a prompt on screen. Quick security reminder: Don’t install any APKs you don’t trust. After APK installation you need to install Octoprint. This is usually as straight forward as clicking a button! If anything weird happens try to uninstall the application and then re-install the APK and retry Octoprint installation. If you are coming from an old installation, this is the time you use your backup. After restoring you need to change serial ports to include /dev/ttyOcto4a and clean the black list below. If you are brand new user, you can connect to octoprint UI with typing your phones ip followed by :5000 into any browser. Example: http://192.168.1.255:5000/. You can follow the setup screen there to setup your device. If you are having problems finding the IP of your phone, you can use the browser on the phone you just setup. Just go to address http://localhost:5000/. Camera Setup You should try out newly revamped built-in camera! It solved a lot of problems from previous Octo4a release. But due to the vast majority of different phones in the market, it sometimes has some problems or overheats the phone. I have a overheating problem due to my phone’s other hardware problem, so I like to use another 3rd part webcam solution. If you had any problems with built-in camera solution. I suggest using app called IP Webcam. You can install via Google Play or use a trusted APK. I suggest these settings on IP Webcam. Video Preferences/Video Resolution: 1280x720, 720p is enough. Video Preferences/Focus Mode: Smooth, for recording video. Power Management/Stop Camera: Disabled. Power Management/Deactivate Display: Enabled. Power Management/Keep Screen Active: Disabled. Power Management/Shallow Sleep: Enabled. Power Management/Stream on Device Boot: Enabled. Audio Mode: Disabled. Optional Permissions/Allow Streaming in Background: Enabled. If you choose to use a 3rd part Camera Application you need to update the camera settings on Octoprint UI. Out of Home Access I’m going to suggest ZeroTier for accessing your server when you are out of your home. This is a bit of a life style change but if you install ZeroTier to every device you own, you can securely access everything from everywhere. ZeroTier acts like a virtual LAN so your devices think you are connected to same modem essentially. You can go to ZeroTier Website to learn how to set it up. Now rather than using your phone’s local IP, you should use Zerotier IP of the phone. For example update the camera settings to use Zerotier IP. You can find out the IP via going inside the app and Clicking at the network name and the IP will be in the managed IP list. Remote Access to Android There is an open source remote access app called Droid VNC-NG. If you install this app to your phone you don’t have to physical access to the phone anymore. You can connect with a VNC Client to control your phone. Installation and setting this application is very straight forward. You can go to Droid VNC-NG’s Github Page to download and install the APK. The app will walk you through the installation. You are pretty much done with this setup except one catch. You should enable double tap to wake up feature of your phone! Whenever you connect to your phone with this application you will connect to a black screen, since your phone is locked you need to be able to unlock it. Double tap solves this since you can send a double tap through DroidVNC-NG. You can enable this via Settings/Display/Tap to Wake: Enabled. Now, You can use any VNC Client Application to access android portion of your setup to tweak in the future. I suggest VNC Viewer on Windows, iOS, Android and Remmina on Linux systems. File Server to Android When you want send a new version of APK or install something new on the phone level you might want to have a easy way to send files over. FTP Server app will create a File Transfer Protocol Server on your phone. Now you can use any FTP Client on your main devices. FileZilla is one of the most common FTP Client. You can get FTP Server on Google Play or use a Trusted APK file. There is very similar apps with very similar names. Whichever one works on your phone is fine.
